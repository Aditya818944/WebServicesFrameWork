âœ… BEFORE You Start Working (Pull Latest Changes)
Even if you're working solo, itâ€™s a good habit in case:

You edited from another computer

You made changes from GitHub

Or you just want to make sure everything is in sync

Run this:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
ðŸ‘‰ This ensures your local code is up-to-date with GitHub.

âœ… WHILE Youâ€™re Working
Make changes, add new files, test, code, etc.

âœ… AFTER You Finish Working
Do this every day before closing your laptop/project:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Check which files changed:
bash
Copy
Edit
git status
ðŸ”¹ 2. Stage changes:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
ðŸ”¹ 3. Commit with a meaningful message:
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "What you did today, like: Added basic router class"
ðŸ”¹ 4. Push to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
ðŸ§  Example Full End-of-Day Flow:
bash
Copy
Edit
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Built request handler for GET and POST methods"
git push origin main
âœ… Summary Cheat Sheet:

Before work	git pull origin main	Sync with GitHub
After changes	git status	See what changed
After work	git add .	Stage all changes
git commit -m "Your message"	Save snapshot
